# Emmanuel's Java Spring Boot Microservice

This microservice is very valuable to Emmanuel. Why? Well, the reason is the fact that this will be his new and restructured portfolio of Java with the Spring Framework. This portfolio will be constantly updated not only with the knowledge he has acquired throughout his years in the software industry, but also with the hands-on experience he has gained.

## Technologies

A brief description of the technologies that will be incorporated day by day and you are going to be able to find in this portfolio:

### Spring Core
We can't move forward without understanding the core of Spring. As a result, you will notice how Emmanuel utilizes this module by implementing dependency injection, declaring and creating beans, injecting beans, managing different bean scopes, and handling their lifecycle.

### Spring Swagger/OpenApi
Documenting our services is a really important process that we shouldn't ignore or skip. That's why, in this Microservice your are going to notice that Emmanuel has used all the possible annotations included by this technologies for achiving a very easier way to understand the porpouse of the differents controllers and endpoints that the microservice offers us. Feel free to access to: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html to review the documentation and testing the endpoints.

### Spring Cloud OpenFeign
We can't talk about microservices architecture without addressing the communication between them within distributed systems. That is why Emmanuel has included this section to demonstrate how to define communication: how to react through `ErrorDecoder` to different Http response codes that we might receive, as well as the definition of fallback beans that can be used to add resilience to microservice failures.
